   .. py:method:: diurnal_correction(degree=3, diff_weight=5.0)

      Apply diurnal corrections
      The diurnal variations may come from base station data (function read_base)
      or, if no base station data exist, they are calculated in function
      diurnal_variation by fitting a polynomial of degree "degree" to the
      measured data. Data of different days are then fitted independently.

      Base station data (measured or calculated) are interpolated onto
      measurement times and simply subtracted from data. The process is done
      in situ, i.e. the values of arrays self.sensor1 and self.sensor2 are
      modified. If you need to keep the original data, you must copy them to
      other arrays before applying diurnal_correction

      :param degree: Degree of polynom to be fitted to data. The default is 3.
                     This parameter is only used if no base station data exist
      :type degree: int, optional
      :param diff_weight: If day_joint_flag is true, diff_weight defines the relative weight
                          for the fit of the differences along the block edges with respect
                          to the fit of the medians.
      :type diff_weight: float, optional



   .. py:method:: diurnal_variation(data, lines, degree=3, diff_weight=1.0)

      Calculate a fit of degree "degree" to the data of lines "lines" which
      will be used for correction of diurnal variations if not base station
      data exist

      :param lines: Numbers of the lines to be used for calculation of diurnal variations.
                    If several files have been loaded, acquired at different days, the
                    fit may be calculated independently for every day.
      :type lines: 1D numpy int array
      :param degree: Degree of polynom to be fitted to data. The default is 3.
      :type degree: int, optional
      :param diff_weight: If all blocks are inverted together, diff_weight is the weight
                          given to fit of differences along the edges with respect to fit
                          of medians in each block. The default is 1.
      :type diff_weight: float, optional

      :returns: * *Polynome coefficients (1D numpy array of size degree+1)* -- The polynome is calculated as
                  P[degree]+P[degree-1]*x+P[degree-2]*x**2...+P[0]*x**degree
                  If multiple blocks are fitted together, P contains a polynome for
                  each block, i.e. len(P) = (degree+1)*number_of_blocks
                * **tmn** (*float*) -- For the stability of polynome fit, times (given in seconds) are
                  reduced such that the minimum time is zero. tmn is this minumum time.
                  To apply the coefficients to data, their time must be transformed to
                  time-tmn before applying the polynome coefficients
